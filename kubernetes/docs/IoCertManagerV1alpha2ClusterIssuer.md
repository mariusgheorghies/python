# IoCertManagerV1alpha2ClusterIssuer

A ClusterIssuer represents a certificate issuing authority which can be referenced as part of `issuerRef` fields. It is similar to an Issuer, however it is cluster-scoped and therefore can be referenced by resources that exist in *any* namespace, not just the same namespace as the referent.
