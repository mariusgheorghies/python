# ComCoreosMonitoringV1PrometheusSpecAdditionalAlertManagerConfigs

AdditionalAlertManagerConfigs allows specifying a key of a Secret containing additional Prometheus AlertManager configurations. AlertManager configurations specified are appended to the configurations generated by the Prometheus Operator. Job configurations specified must have the form as specified in the official Prometheus documentation: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#alertmanager_config. As AlertManager configs are appended, the user is responsible to make sure it is valid. Note that using this feature may expose the possibility to break upgrades of Prometheus. It is advised to review Prometheus release notes to ensure that no incompatible AlertManager configs are going to break Prometheus after the upgrade.
