# ComGrafanaMonitoringV1alpha1MetricsInstanceSpecAdditionalScrapeConfigs

AdditionalScrapeConfigs lets you specify a key of a Secret containing additional Grafana Agent Prometheus scrape configurations. The specified scrape configurations are appended to the configurations generated by Grafana Agent Operator. Specified job configurations must have the form specified in the official Prometheus documentation: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config. As scrape configs are appended, you must make sure the configuration is still valid. Note that it's possible that this feature will break future upgrades of Grafana Agent. Review both Grafana Agent and Prometheus release notes to ensure that no incompatible scrape configs will break Grafana Agent after the upgrade.
